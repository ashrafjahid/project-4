		Hello! I’m Md. Ashraful Islam, an Assistant Teacher at 
	Andharmanik Government Primary School with a background in 
	business and technology. I hold both an MBA and a BBA in 
	Accounting, which have equipped me with a strong foundation 
	in analytical thinking and problem-solving. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Alongside my teaching career, I’m also a skilled Graphic 
	Designer and Full Stack Web Developer, passionate about 
	blending creativity with technology to build visually appealing 
	and functional digital solutions. Whether it’s designing a 
	logo or developing a dynamic web application, I enjoy bringing 
	ideas to life.
	</p>

	<p>
		In my free time, I love gardening, travelling, and learning 
	new things—always curious, always growing.
